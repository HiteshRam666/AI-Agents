## 🧠 What Are AI Agents?

AI agents are programs that:
- **Perceive** their environment 🌍
- **Process** information to make decisions 🤔
- **Act** to achieve specific goals 🎯

---

## 🚀 Features

✨ **Reactive Agents**: Quick responses to stimuli  
✨ **Goal-Based Agents**: Thoughtful planning for long-term success  
✨ **Learning Agents**: Smart evolution over time 🧬  
✨ **Multi-Agent Systems**: Collaborative and competitive interactions 🤝

## 🧩 How It Works

1. 🕵️ **Perception**: The agent gathers data through sensors or inputs.  
2. 🤔 **Decision-Making**: Processes data using algorithms to determine actions.  
3. 🎬 **Action**: Executes the chosen action to interact with the environment.
